# Examples

Real-world Source of Truth documents created with this skill:

| Project | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Clarity Gate | Research documentation for pre-ingestion verification | [clarity-gate/docs/research/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md](https://github.com/frmoretto/clarity-gate/blob/main/docs/research/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md) |

## What Makes a Good Example

Examples should demonstrate:

1. **Verification Status box** — Clear qualification of what's verified
2. **Staleness markers** — `[STABLE]`, `[VOLATILE]`, `[CHECK BEFORE CITING]`
3. **Self-assessment labeling** — Explicitly marked as author judgment
4. **Absence claim hedging** — "to author's knowledge" language
5. **Estimates separated** — NOT in Verified Data tables
